# Project

About me:
A person who interested and passion in programming/coding.
I have around a years and half of programming experiences in school.
I don't have any comfortable languages yet, but I am currently getting into C++ language.
My future aspirations in programming is artifical intelligence.
I like best about computer programming is the ability to design your own system/functions within the limits.
I like least about computer programming is the time consuming on tracking and fixing errors, which took most the of project time beside commenting. Missing semicolon at somewhere deep inside the code could be really confusing.
